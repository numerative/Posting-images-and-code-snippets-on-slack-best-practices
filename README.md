# Sharing Images and Code Snippets on Slack - Best Practices

Starting a thread on images and code snippets is not the same as starting a thread text only thread. Each new reply gets published on the main channel thread and we all agree that it creates a clutter.

So how can we include images in our slack messages and keep comments condensed, like this?

All we have to do is paste the image link in the box and the image would expand inline. The process involves a couple of steps more, but there are a couple of advantages to this. One, you can write text before you publish and two, you can include more than one image in a single post. So here is how it can be done.

**Step 1:** Select files from your computer (just as regular).

**Step 2:** Uncheck the "Share in" checkbox

**Step 3:** *Menu Button* > Your files

Replies to this thread will now not appear on the main channel thread, now.

Similar steps can be followed for posting code snippets too.

Since this involves more steps, let's see how many will adopt. Will you? Let me know.

Hope it helps. ðŸ™‚
